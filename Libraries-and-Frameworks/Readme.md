## Libraries vs. Frameworks

JavaScript libraries and frameworks provide pre-built code that **streamlines the development process**. While both libraries and frameworks serve to **improve productivity** and **standardize coding practices**, they differ in their **approach** and **level of control** they provide to developers.

- **Libraries** are generally more focused on providing **solutions to specific tasks**, such as manipulating the DOM, handling events, or managing AJAX requests.

  - jQuery
  - React

- **Frameworks**, on the other hand, provide a more **defined structure for building applications**. They often come with **a set of rules and conventions** that developers need to follow.

  - Next.js
  - Angular
  - Svelte
  - Remix

Although libraries and frameworks are used across projects of all sizes, the choice between using them often depends on the **project's requirements**. Libraries offer **flexibility for specific functionalities**, while frameworks provide **a structured approach towards complex applications**.

- Libraries and frameworks are widely used for several reasons. They significantly **speed up development** by providing **quick solutions for common problems**.

- Libraries and frameworks follow **best practices and patterns** that have been proven effective in real life scenarios. This can lead to **more robust and scalable applications**.

## Single Page Applications (SPAs)

Unlike traditional multi-page websites, single page applications (SPAs) **load only one HTML page** and **dynamically update the content** as the user interacts with the app, **without reloading the entire page**. This approach can lead to **faster, more responsive applications**, but it also comes with a set of **challenges** and **considerations**.

- SPAs **heavily use JavaScript** to manage the application's state and render content. Instead of requesting new HTML pages from the server, SPAs use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and fetch data asynchronously.

### Drawbacks of SPAs

- **SEO** Optimization

- **Navigation** and browser **history**.

- **Unable to bookmark** any specific page.

- **Performance** is impacted due to a large/bloated bundle size.

- **Screen readers may struggle** with dynamically updated content. (Accessibility)

- **Refreshing the page might reset the application** to its initial state, rather than maintaining the current view.
