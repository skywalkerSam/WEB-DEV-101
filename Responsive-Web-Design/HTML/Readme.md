# HTML Notes

## Void Elements

- Some HTML elements do not have a closing tag. These are known as void elements.

- Here is an example of an image element which is a void element: `<img>`

- While many code formatters like _Prettier_, will choose to include the `/` in void elements (`<img />`), the HTML spec states that the presence of the `/` "does not mark the start tag as self-closing but instead is unnecessary and has no effect of any kind".
