# CSS Notes


if you think of a website as a house, `HTML` would be the foundation and framework, while `CSS` would be the paint, wallpaper, and decorations that make the house *visually appealing* and **unique***

- if `HTML` is the structure of a web page, `CSS` is what makes it *look good*.

- `CSS` works by selecting `HTML` *elements* and applying styles to them.

- `CSS` plays a vital role in creating visually appealing, responsive, and *user-friendly* websites.

Another important feature of `CSS` is its *cascading* nature, which is where the "cascading" in its name comes from (`Cascading Style Sheets`). This means that styles can be *inherited* and **overridden**, allowing for a hierarchical structure of *styling*. it allows you to build engaging web *experiences* that capture users' **attention** and enhance their interaction with web content.

## Basic Anatomy of a CSS Rule

1. A `selector`, which is a pattern used in CSS to identify and **target** specific HTML elements for styling.

    - `type` selectors
  
    - `class` selectors
  
    - `ID` selectors

2. A `declaration` block, which is a set of *styles* for a given selector, or *selectors*.

     - `property`

     - `value`

```css

selector {
  property: value;
}
```

`Note`: After each *property* name, you need to place a colon(`:`), and after each *value*, you should have a semicolon(`;`).
